# **Hi! My name is Jesus!**

### **About me**
I enjoy designing and building new software solutions that can help people's daily problems. I am looking forward to become a professional **backend developer**, but I'm also very interested on Artificial Intelligence and how we can use it to make innovative solutions.

Currently studying Informatics Engineering degree at [UIB](https://www.uib.cat/). I'm very passionate about the tech world and learning new things about it, such as learning new technologies or understanding how does the technology that we use every day work.

Working mostly on [academic projects](https://github.com/jcasben/Programacion-Ing-Informatica), but developing personal ones on my free time.
